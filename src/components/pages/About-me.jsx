        <p>I'm a hardworking engineer with adaptability in adverse situations, 
          with abilities to work under pressure and deliver projects on time. 
          A big fan of solving problems and learning about my professional areas of interest such as automation,
           data science, cloud computing, and IT.

          As a fresh engineer, I love to learn, and I consider myself a very passionate professional that enjoys 
          developing technological challenges and making them grow.

          Today, I'm looking to develop my coding skills through the Tecnologico de Monterrey Coding Bootcamp. 
          I understand the day-to-day changing trends in industrial technology, 
          so I'm seeking to develop my knowledge to have a greater impact in Industry 4.0.</p>
